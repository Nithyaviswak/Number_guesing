What Is a Number Guessing Game?
The computer randomly selects a number within a range (e.g., 1 to 100).

The player inputs guesses.

After each guess, the computer gives feedback:

“Too high” if the guess is above the target.

“Too low” if the guess is below the target.

“Correct!” if the guess matches the target.
